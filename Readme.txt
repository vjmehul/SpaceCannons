To complete to setup go to \SpaceCannons\ in cmd and type "pip install -e ."

After this you can run the random_inputs file to display the game screen

More modifications can be done from Game_param files which is in two locations in the game directory(this needs to be fixed yet)

Other graphical game functions are turned off for this version but you can initialize then through SpaceCannons.py file
